-- | Recursively list all the files and directories in a directory and all subdirectories.
--
-- The order places files in sub-directories after all the files in their
-- parent directories. The list is generated lazily so is not well defined if
-- the source directory structure changes before the list is fully consumed.
--
-- Symlinks within directory structure may cause result to be infinitely long.

{-# INLINE listContentsRecFold #-}
-- | The most general form of gathering directory contents.
--
-- Treats symlinks the same as regular files and directories. Folding functions can
-- decide how to handle symlinks.
--
-- Both directory and file actions can throw exceptions and this function
-- will try to close finished directory streams promptly (theyâ€™ll be closed
-- by GC in the worst case).

  :: forall f a. Foldable f

  -- ^ Depth limit if specified, negative values treated the same as positive ones.
  -> (forall b. OsPath -> Relative OsPath -> Basename OsPath -> FileType -> (a -> IO b -> IO b) -> (IO b -> IO b) -> IO b -> IO b)
  -- ^ Prepare to fold directory given its path.
  --
  -- Can do IO actions to plan what to do and typically should derive its
  -- result from last @IO b@ argument. Ignoring it will terminate content enumeration
  -- and not produce any more results.
  --
  -- The passed @(a -> IO b -> IO b)@ argument function can be used
  -- to record some output about the directory itself.
  --
  -- The passed @(IO b -> IO b)@ argument function should (but is not required to)
  -- be applied in the returned function and it will prepend results for subdirectories
  -- of the directory being analyzed. If not applied thes subdirectories will be skipped,
  -- this way ignoring particular directory and all its children can be achieved.
